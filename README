**** BUG TRACKER ****

A fun, challenging, versatile, useful app for recording and tracking bugs and
feature requests.

VERSION 0.1
A CLI interface with the following features:
- Create a new bug or feature request (bofr)
- Link the bofr to a project - either choose from a list or create a new one
  (i.e. the bofr has an attribute called 'Project' that takes the name of
  a project as its value)
- Bofr is only editable by developer - dev and submitted communicate via email
  if necessary
- Bofr must have a status; 
    - new (just submitted, not claimed by any developer yet)
    - not accepted (considered by the dev team, found not valid or feasible)
    - assigned (to a dev)
    - request clarification (sent back to the submitter)
    - scheduled (assigned a specific resolution date, typically aligned with
      a dot release)
    - closed (bug squashed, feature implemented)


VERSION 1.0
A web app with the following features:
- As above;
- Authorisation and authentication of users: devs and users can use the same
  app
- Users can upvote BOFRs they consider urgent or important
- Submitter views:
  - bofr submitted by me
  - bofr submitted for given app
- Dev views:
  - bofr assigned to me
  - bofr for given app

Since it's a portfolio project I will try and incorporate an external DB, but
the 0.1 version won't need that. (The 1.0 version really doesn't need it either
but it shows that I know how to use databases.)
