 <h1>The power of transition songs</h1>



<p>Children can be focused like nobody else. They allow themselves to be absorbed by what they’re doing, by the worlds they make up and the stories they create.<br />

The downside of such focus is that, should the real world demand attention for some reason, it can be painful to leave the imaginary one behind. At such occasions a transition song can be a real help.</p>



<h3>Time for breakfast!</h3>

<p>A is playing with two cars, racing them up and down the windowsill in the playroom. It’s time for breakfast - the littlest one is already in his chair, the other two are helping set the table.<br />

I call out to A, telling him breakfast is ready and to come to the living room. There’s no response. I set the chairs into place, calling A again when we’re nearly done. He indicates that he heard me, but doesn’t stop playing to come to breakfast.<br />

Everyone is in their chairs by this time and clamoring for their meal. I know if I walk away now to get A I will have some very upset toddlers on my hands, but I don’t have an alternative. I end up having to carry him most of the way from the playroom and get him into his chair as quickly as possible, with much noise from everybody involved.</p>



<h3>Time for bed!</h3>

<p>It’s nearly 7pm, the kids have had their bath and are in their pyjamas. A is drinking his bottle - his brothers and sister are playing or reading a bit.<br />

When A finishes his bottle I start singing our bedtime song. Immediately the kids stop what they’re doing and start marching down the hall, stepping in time with the song and trying to copy a few words. There’s a brief tussle over who gets to take the owl to bed tonight - it’s the current favourite.<br />

In no time at all, the kids reach their bedroom door and file in. I lift each into their bed while the oldest helps to close the blinds and curtains.</p>



<h3></h3>

<p>There will be some kids for whom this works better than others, and some that have little trouble leaving their fantasy world behind. For our little family and our family’s little quirks, having transition songs is a lifesaver.<br />

Joining a child in their game and guiding them out of it when it’s time for breakfast is simply not always possible when there are other children and other responsibilities clamoring for your attention. Offering a treat as a distraction or a reward for good behaviour is a bad idea for many reasons.<br />

But once a song is associated with a certain activity - breakfast, bedtime, or
anything else - singing that song becomes a gentle yet powerful transition into
the activity. Usually there is no struggle, often it’s not even necessary to
ask or tell the kids what to do or what is going to happen. They will know, and
automatically start doing what needs to be done, because to them it will feel
like it was their idea.</p>
