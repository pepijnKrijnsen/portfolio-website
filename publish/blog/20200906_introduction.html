<h1>Family, music, and tech - an introduction</h1>

<p>These three words describe 90% of what goes on in my life. They have done so for years and I
hope they will continue to do so for many more.</p>

<h2>Family</h2>

<p>At first glance, they are the people I share my life with. My wife and our four children. But 
really it's much more than that.<br />
<br />
They are the reason I do what I do for a job. Right now I don't find my job particularly 
interesting or engaging; I took it almost five years ago because my wife and I had just moved to a new 
part of the country, she was pregnant with our first, and we needed a stable income.<br />
They are the reason to get up in the morning - even if that's earlier than I would like to - and 
to take care of myself, physically and mentally, so I can do it again tomorrow.<br />
<br />
They are the reason I try to be the best I can be, as often as I can manage it.</p>

<h2>Music</h2>

<p>I have been listening and playing for as long as I can remember. My dad gave me my first guitar 
at age 6 and I've been hooked ever since. I love playing on stage, I love playing with friends, I 
love playing alone - the place, the situation, are more or less irrelevant.<br />
<br />
Of course I sometimes wished I had more time for music, and it's fun to think about what my life 
might have been like had I pursued a career in music more seriously. But really, right now it's 
exactly what it should be: </p>

<h2>Technology</h2>

<p>Like music, technology has always been a part of my life - and again it was mostly my dad's 
influence, as he was a sysadmin (or, as it says on my birth cert, "analyst" - because how else do 
you explain to a 1989 civil servant what exactly your job entails) and we always had old computers 
around the house.<br />
<br />
I remember writing my first few programs in GWBASIC under Windows 3.1, and explaining to my younger 
brother why writing programs that accepted user input took much longer than ones that simply 
displayed some lines on a screen, because they had to be made "fool-proof" against invalid input 
from the user. Nowadays I run Windows (10 Enterprise - for work), Mac OS (High Sierra - for home 
recording) and Linux (currently Debian and Puppy Linux, after having tried about a dozen) on 
various laptops and other computers.</p>

<p>Next week I'll be sharing my home server journey: how did I get to what I'm using, and what's in 
store for the future.</p>
