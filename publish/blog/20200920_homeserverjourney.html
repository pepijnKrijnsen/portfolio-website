 <h1>Kinda-sorta-server</h1>



<p>Being a total nerd, I’ve always been attracted to the idea of a central home computer doing the heavy lifting - storage and backup, serving movies and music, and running my own Git server and small webserver for development purposes.</p>



<h3>The machine</h3>

<p>Since this was totally a vanity project and would not be making money or change my life, I wanted to do it without spending anything. This machine was my first foray into the world of Linux partly for that reason - although mostly because it seemed fun messing around with an interesting OS.<br />

The only unused device I had at this point was an old 2009 white plastic Macbook rocking a 2.4GHz Core 2 Duo and 4 gigs of RAM. Not much, but plenty for my intended use.<br />



<h3>The distro</h3>

<p>I had very little experience with Windows command prompt, and none at all with Linux based operating systems, so I was looking for something that was (1) easy to use, and (2) lightweight enough for my little old laptop to run. Initially I tried Bodhi Linux, which was visually stunning given its very modest requirements, but we never really clicked. Then I discovered Puppy Linux and fell in love.</p>



<h3>Doggy</h3>

<p>Puppy Linux is a lightweight distro that is loaded into RAM at boot and runs entirely from memory. Since the system never needs to read from storage for any OS operations it’s extremely snappy on slow systems. Since the OS itself was designed with a focus on small size and it uses the tiny JWM desktop environment, it can run on a measly 256MB of RAM with a recommended 512MB swap file; 1/16 of my laptop’s memory.<br />

While I adore Puppy Linux and its founder’s approach to designing an operating system, it turned out to be less than ideal for a server build. I’m sure it can be made to work, especially given the extreme flexibility of Puppy, but for a novice Linux user it was not great.<br />

I even toyed with an X-less install of Arch for a while, installing it on both my server laptop and dual-booted on my Chromebook. I loved Arch, too - to me it’s the epitome of what desktop Linux is about. You get a base system and install only what you want. But this again proved a little over my head and not great for a server build.</p>



<h3>The obvious choice</h3>

<p>In the end I went with Debian, installing the base OS without any desktop environment and manually installing X and Awesome Window Manager afterwards. I would mostly be using it from terminal but the server does have a monitor connected, so I can use it directly from my desk if I happen to be there.<br />

Debian has been super stable, as expected, and since I’m not using any resource-heavy environments or applications my old Macbook has been running like a charm. Long may it last!</p>
