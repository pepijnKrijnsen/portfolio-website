<h1>Hotkeys and more</h1>

<p>Windows is great at some things, but it's not the most flexible when it
comes to customising your experience. The AutoHotkey scripting language allows
you to create powerful automations, build your own GUIs, and share your
scripts and apps with other Windows users.</p>

<h3>A little history</h3>
<p>AutoHotkey (AHK) is an open source fork of the AutoIt language. AutoIt is
a very powerful macro and automation language with a BASIC-like syntax
originally released in 1999. While it can be used to define custom hotkeys and hotstrings, its focus is on
automation of routine tasks such as systems management/monitoring and batch
installation of applications.<br />
AutoIt initially made its source code available under the GPL but stopped doing
so at version 3.2 in 2006. AHK is a fork of the last open source version
of AutoIt and its source code is available under the GPL license.</p>

<h3>Hotkeys galore</h3>
<p>In AHK, remapping a key is extremely straightforward. If I want to use my
CapsLock key to act as left Control - because who uses capslock - it's simply
<code>capslock::lctrl</code>. No other action or syntax is involved. Similarly,
if I want to define a hotstring 'kire' to expand to 'Kind regards,' I can use
<code>::kire::Kind regards,</code> on a single line to achieve this. Note the
leading '::' to define a hotstring.<br />
Defining a hotkey to perform a certain action is almost as straightforward as
remapping a key. I use windows key + r to move a window to the middle of my screen, and
resize it in such a way that the whole window is visible.
Windows likes creating windows either completely off-screen, or
so small that they cannot be dragged or resized. Using this hotkey I can stop
such shenanigans: <code>#r::winmove, A, , 80, 50, 1000, 650</code>.<br />
The hash sign is AHK code for the Windows key. Other identifiers are ^ for
Control, + for Shift, and ! for Alt. Winmove is an AHK command that, you
guessed it, moves (and optionally resizes) a window. The letter A is AHK
shortcut for the currently active window. 80 and 50 are the X and Y position in
pixels relative to the screen, and 1000 and 650 are the new width and height
I want the window to have.</p>

<h3>Advanced stuff</h3>
<p>These examples show how easy it is to create custom hotkeys, but AHK can do
much more complicated stuff if necessary. You can define subroutines,
functions, and classes (and extend from classes) and it supports advanced data
types including numbered arrays and key/value arrays. You can create your own
GUIs and interact with any files on your system - assuming the user that's
executing the script is authorised to access to those files, that is. The syntax is not always
the most straightforward, but it is an extremely stable and resource-friendly
language.<br />
Moreover, it is extremely
closely integrated with Windows: it can access system values such as the
current contents of the clipboard, user idle time, and a host of other things
through built-in variables. It's an interpreted language but it comes with its
own "exe creator" that allows you to turn any script into a stand-alone
executable. When creating an executable, any imports of external AHK files (whether
explicit or implicit) are baked into the end result to create a truly
stand-alone application.</p>

<h3>How much magic</h3>
<p>Of course, AHK is no magic bullet. It won't be able to solve every Windows 
problem you have, and as a full-fledged programming language it doesn't hold a 
candle to the likes of Java, C# or even Python. 
It's also not great at automating web pages, although there are ways to get 
around that.<br />
But when it comes to defining keymaps, setting up hotkeys, writing automations, 
and building simple Windows GUIs for yourself and your team of Windows users, 
there is nothing faster & easier than writing a quick AHK script.</p>
