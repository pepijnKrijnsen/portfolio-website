         <h1>The key</h1>

<p>In the 25+ years I've been playing music I have practiced multiple
instruments, but never spent much time on piano. My wife and I recently
purchased a new digital piano for use by both ourselves and the kids
and I've been having tremendous fun getting to know her
ins and outs.</p>

<h3>Guitars, whistles, misc</h3>
<p>My first and greatest love is the guitar. I started playing classical guitar
at age 7 and although I stopped having lessons after about 3 years, I never
really stopped playing since. I mostly played whatever I enjoyed listening to,
as long as it didn't sound completely out of place on six strings.<br />
I always had a special place in my heart for folk music, in particular celtic
folk - traditional tunes from Ireland, Scotland, and Brittany. I started
practicing the tin whistle and joined a band where I played guitar and
whistles.
The other band members were classically trained and encouraged me to learn more about music theory.</p>

<h3>Keys in a row</h3>
<p>We had an old upright piano at home when I was little, but I can't have
spent more than an hour in ten years playing it. To me it lacked the inherent
rhythm of strumming chords, and I could not play melody on it
with the ease that I had gotten used to on guitar. As a student I had a crummy
keyboard, mostly for adding percussion and organ parts to music that I was by this
time writing and recording - I never used it to play actual piano pieces.<br />
Now that I'm putting some actual time and effort into learning to play, I'm
discovering new things about music. Building and shifting chords on
a piano is completely different, yet extremely familiar. Piano chords
tend to consist of the 'pure' three or four notes, rather than the typical 4-6
when playing 'cowboy chords' on guitar. It becomes easier to tell apart
differences in subsequent chords, and the interplay between chord and melody
sounds subtly more profound.</p>

<h3>Purity</h3>
<p>The digital piano cannot be out of tune. You can play terribly dissonant
combinations of notes, but each note individually will always have exactly the
correct frequency. Guitars, by contrast, are inherently out of tune. Even if
an individual string is tuned to perfection, pressing down that string even
with perfect intonation will always produce an ever so slightly out of tune
note.<br />
This is very much part of the charm of guitar music, and not something that
players should strive to prevent in my opinion. I'm certainly not saying that
a piano is objectively a better instrument because of this characteristic,
either - and it's not entirely true of acoustic pianos anyway.<br />
It does mean
that putting music theory to practice is easier when playing piano than when
playing guitar. All of your notes are in a row, clearly contrasting whole notes
with sharps and flats. Playing a C major chord on that row of notes is as
simple as grabbing each second white note from C until you run out of fingers.
Changing to an A minor by shifting your last finger up one, or to an Em by
shifting your first finger down one, exposes the relationship between those
chords.</p>

<h3>No contest</h3>
<p>Guitar will always be my first and greatest love. It is expressive in a way
that no other instrument could ever match, and it has taught me countless
lessons in practice and theory. I'm only able to progress quickly on piano
because of all the experience gained on guitar.<br />
Playing piano is
teaching me other lessons, broadening my horizon, enriching my experience, and
making me a better guitarist in the process.</p>
